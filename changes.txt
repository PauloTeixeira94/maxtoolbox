Max ToolBox - Release notes

Version b13

* Changed the way the patch loads on startup :
    There is now a single "Activate" checkbox in the ToolBox.maxpat patch (that is usually in the extras folder).
    Clicking the checkbox will activate the ToolBox.
    You can now close the ToolBox.maxpat patch and the ToolBox will remain active.
    To close the ToolBox, reopen the ToolBox.maxpat patch and deactivate the checkbox.
    If the checkbox is activated, the ToolBox will always load with Max, even if the ToolBox.maxpat patch is closed.
